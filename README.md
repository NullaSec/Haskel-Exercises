# Haskell Exercises
Here are the Haskell exercises I've been solving on my journey learning this language. If you want to check the answers [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/NullaSec/Haskel-Exercises/blob/main/HSexercises.hs).

#### 1. Output a temperature value in Farenheit after giving a value in Celsius.
NOTE: ºF = ºC x 1.8 + 32

#### 2. Create the necessary functions to make a simple calculator: Addiction, Subtraction, Division and Multiplication

#### 3. A game awards the players a certain amount of money based on their score. Create a function that calculates the amount of money given to the score input.

|     Score    |  Prize in $ |
|:------------:|:-----------:|
|    1 to 10   |     100     |
|   10 to 20   |     200     |
|   20 to 30   |     300     |
|   30 to 40   |     400     |
|   40 to 50   |     500     |
| More than 50 |     600     |

#### 4. The price of a plane ticket changes based on the age of the traveler. People over the age of 60 pay 60% of the total price. Children younger than 10 years old pay 50% and babies (younger than 2 years old) pay only 10% of the total price of the ticket. Create a function that given the age of the traveler and price of the ticket outputs the price they need to pay.

#### 5. Create a function that receives a value and returns "True" if the value is an even number.
